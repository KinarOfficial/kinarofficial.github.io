        <p>I have very little experience with Web Design and Development. I've taken some courses here are CCC and used HTML/CSS a little before but never focused on really designing anything. <br><br>
        I would like to learn how make more professional responsive websites that you would see from big companies or at least big tech companies. <br><br>
        My hopes are to take my new knowledge of HTML/CSS and proper design schemes and create a personal website to display my own creative works and to potentially get a career designing and setting up websites. </p>
